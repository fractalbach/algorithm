# Algorithm

Collection of Algorithms written in the [Go Programming Language (golang)](https://golang.org/).


## What ~~is this~~ will this be?  


* Practical Toolkit of useful data structures and algorithms
* Interesting ways to interact with the structures
* Easy to summon the power of the algorithms
* A flexible way to invoke the glorious power of `structure.algorithm(input)`
* A philosopher stone to convert your input into solid gold output.

* A practically theoretical toolkit of jokes.

## Current Status


* Not optimized.
* Not easily usable (*yet*).
* like a UDP packet, this currently is a "connectionless", "unreliable" project that makes a "best-effort" implementation.


## Purpose

Currently, my purpose for creating this is...

* because it is fun.
* because golang is an interesting language.
* to learn more about algorithms and data structures.





## Credits:

* *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiseron, Riverst, and Stein
* The many people who actually came up with these algorithms in the first place.
